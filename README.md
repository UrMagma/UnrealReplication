Project: GlobalReplication Module - Status & Roadmap
‚úÖ What I've Done (Completed Tasks)
I have successfully built the foundation of a professional, feature-rich replication system. Here are the key features that are complete and working:

Complete Project Restructuring: The original codebase has been replaced with a clean, modular C++ project structure.
Core System Design: The system is built on a foundation of interfaces (IReplicationDriver, IReplicationConnection, IReplicatedObject) for maximum flexibility and extensibility.
Network Transport Layer: A basic UDP socket layer has been implemented, allowing the system to send and receive data over the network.
Efficient Property Replication:
Property Diffing: The system only sends properties that have changed, significantly reducing bandwidth.
Object Prioritization: The replication driver intelligently prioritizes more important objects to ensure they are updated first.
RPC Framework: A basic framework for Remote Procedure Calls (RPCs) is in place, allowing for parameter-less functions to be called on remote objects.
Build System: The project uses CMake for easy, cross-platform building.
Example Application: A main.cpp file demonstrates all the core features and serves as a testbed.
Documentation: A README.md file has been created to explain the project.
‚öôÔ∏è How It Works (Architecture Overview)
The system is designed around a few core concepts:

The ReplicationDriver: This is the main hub of the system. It manages all client connections and runs the main replication loop (the "tick").
The ReplicationConnection: This represents a single connection to a client. It knows which objects need to be replicated to that specific client.
The IReplicatedObject Interface: Any object you want to replicate must implement this interface. It uses a property system (FRepProperty<T>) to automatically track which variables have changed.
The Replication Loop: On each tick, the ReplicationDriver:
Gathers all the "dirty" (changed) objects for each connection.
Sorts these objects by priority.
Serializes the changed properties into a buffer.
Sends the buffer over the network.
The RPC Flow:
You can declare RPCs in your IReplicatedObject classes using macros.
When an RPC is called on a client, the system automatically serializes the function call and sends it to the server.
The server receives the RPC, finds the correct object, and executes the function.
üöÄ What's Next (Roadmap)
Here are the next steps to make the system even more powerful and feature-complete:

[In Progress] Sub-object Replication:
Goal: Allow objects to have "components" that are also replicated.
Status: I am currently implementing this feature. I have added a UReplicatedComponent class and updated the driver to handle sub-objects. I am currently fixing a compilation error related to this change.
Dormancy and Relevance:
Goal: Further optimize bandwidth by not replicating objects that are not changing or are not relevant to a client (e.g., too far away).
RPCs with Parameters:
Goal: Extend the RPC framework to support parameters of various types.
Note: This is a complex feature that may require advanced C++ techniques or code generation to implement robustly.
Network Ownership:
Goal: Implement logic for transferring network authority of objects between clients (e.g., for picking up an item).
Advanced Network Features:
Goal: Improve the socket layer with features like reliability (guaranteed packet delivery), congestion control, and packet ordering.
